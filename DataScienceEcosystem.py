# - Evaluate simple arithmetic expressions

# Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:
# 
# 1. Python
# 2. R
# 3. SQL
# 4. C++
# 5. Scala
# 6. Matlab
# 7. Java

# Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:
# 
# 1. Pandas
# 2. PyTorch
# 3. NumPy
# 4. Seaborn
# 5. SciPy
# 6. Plotly

# | Data Science Tools |

# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python.

# In[13]:


# This is a simple arithmetic expression to multiply then add integers
(3*4)+5


# In[14]:


# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by dividing by 60.

i = round(200/60, 2)
print("200 minutes is " + str(i) + " Hours")
